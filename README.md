# thesis


### Topics

There's two major line of enquiry for the thesis. The first one is the centre's current research area, which is short-term conventional ML-based weather modelling. The second is my original idea, which is applications of long-term climate modelling combined with conventional geospatial methods to identify areas of urban and rural insight.

### climateModelling

which is really more like weather modelling; This is most of the work we've done with the centre over the summer.
 
### Data

 - IMD has 1x1 temperature from 1951 to 2024 - which we've downloaded as ``heat_main``.
 - IMD has 2.5x2.5 temperature from June 2015 to 2024, which is about 9 years, which we've downloaded as ``heat_rt``. Is 9 years enough to draw meaningful inferences? It definitely isn't for climate, but maybe for weather?
